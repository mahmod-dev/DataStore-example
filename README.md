Full example to use preference dataStore with generic class 

We have two ways to write data into dataStore
Fisrt way:
Write data Synchronously by using runBlocking {}

Second way:
Write data Asynchronously by using lifecycleScope.launch {}

When read data from dataStore we have to use livedata to observe data when it is changed.
